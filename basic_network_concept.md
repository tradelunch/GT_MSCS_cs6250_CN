However, we know it is hard to know what you don’t know! Therefore, we provide the following questions to help students assess whether there are any gaps to fill in. This list is not exhaustive, but should be a good starting point.

What is a “protocol”? What are some of the most well-known and used protocols?

What is an ISP? What is an AS?

What is the OSI layer model? What is the primary responsibility of each layer?

How does the layered architecture of the internet allow fundamentally different technologies (such as WiFi vs. Ethernet) to be used together?

What is the client-server model? What is the peer-to-peer model? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?

What is a port (number)? How is it used?

What’s the difference between a well-known port number and an ephemeral port?

What is TCP? What is UDP? What are some of the major differences between them?

If you were developing a brand new application layer protocol, what aspects of TCP would make it more appealing to use? What aspects of UDP would make it more appealing to use?

What is a socket? How is it used?

Can you generally describe how HTTP works in an example (how the HTTP request is initiated, how the webserver receives the request, how the content is returned, etc.)?

What is an IP address? How is it different than a MAC Address?

What is a switch? What is a router? What are the major differences between the roles that they play in a network, classically?

What is a default gateway?

What happens to a message as it gets sent across a network, as far as encapsulation and protocol headers?

What is DNS? At a high level, how does it work?

We will not be providing an “answer key”, but we encourage students to spend time working together and talking these questions out. Please note: while the TA team may discuss some of these concepts (especially the ones directly discussed in the course content) with students, as these questions are intended to assist students with procuring prerequisite knowledge for the course, discussing these questions is a low priority for the TAs.

There are a lot of really good resources around the internet to help you answer these questions. Note that there is an IT perspective (which is much more concerned about using network technologies to meet an organization’s needs, such as taking an address space and splitting it up into subnets for different zones in a network), but this course is from a CS perspective (which is more concerned with how network technologies work and interact, such as how TCP congestion control is not well-suited for VoIP). We encourage you to share any good resources you find with your classmates.

As a head start, here are some resources that we think might help:

“Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach” by Kurose and Ross is one of the classic texts in the field, and is the textbook for many undergraduate courses. The 6th and 7th editions were used as one of the several resources for developing the material in this course. Link - 7th edition on Amazon

A free, online textbook on computer networks. Link - “An Introduction to Computer Networks”
